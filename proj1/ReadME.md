## **Section 1: How to compile and execute code** ##
1. Go to terminal and make sure you are in current directory of .java files and Dataset files
2. Type in "java Main number" where you input an numbers of frames inside the bracket argument
3. Wait for the "Ready for input message." print out
4. Provide valid inputs for test cases

## **Section 2: Test results** ##

The program was able to pass the test cases. 

## **Section 3: Design decisions** ##
I decided to use an isEmpty method to make it easier to identify which frames were empty and which were not and instead taken out.
